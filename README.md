# canopy-growth-abm
Agent-based modelling of canopy extent, canopy rate, and tree-related cooling effect for the canton of Geneva

Two readme files are available, one destined to [users](https://github.com/swiss-territorial-data-lab/canopy-growth-abm/blob/8f20e69359b0db12273fd957c7affb25d3f11116/readme/1readme_USER.pdf) of the model, and one destined to [programmers](https://github.com/swiss-territorial-data-lab/canopy-growth-abm/blob/8f20e69359b0db12273fd957c7affb25d3f11116/readme/2readme_PROGRAMMER.pdf) and users who wish to perform the simulations on the region of their choice.

The ["CanopyGrowth" folder](https://github.com/swiss-territorial-data-lab/canopy-growth-abm/blob/8f20e69359b0db12273fd957c7affb25d3f11116/CanopyGrowth) contains the [GAMA model](https://github.com/swiss-territorial-data-lab/canopy-growth-abm/blob/8f20e69359b0db12273fd957c7affb25d3f11116/CanopyGrowth/models/CanopyGrowthModel.gaml) itself and its [required files](https://github.com/swiss-territorial-data-lab/canopy-growth-abm/blob/8f20e69359b0db12273fd957c7affb25d3f11116/CanopyGrowth/includes). It is linked to the "readme_USER" and "readme_PROGRAMMER" documentation files.
