# canopy-growth-abm
Agent-based modelling of canopy extent, canopy rate, and tree-related cooling effect for the canton of Geneva

Two readme files are available, one destined to users of the model, and one destined to programmers and users who wish to perform the simulations on the region of their choice.

The "CanopyGrowth" folder contains the GAMA model itself and its required files. It is linked to the "readme_USER" and "readme_PROGRAMMER" documentation files.

The "python" folder contains all python scripts for data treatment and formatting. It is linked to the "readme_PROGRAMMER" documentation file.

The full report "CanopyGrowthABM_Report.pdf" for the project is also available in the root folder.
